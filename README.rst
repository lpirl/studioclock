dev notes
---------

Audio generated using `"texttowave" script
<https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2581610>`__ and language model
``tts_models/en/jenny/jenny``.

To test all language models::

  NUMS="zero one too tree four fife six seven ait nine"

  for m in $(python3 ./texttowav -m list - | grep /en/); do \
  echo $NUMS | sed 's/ /. /g' | python3 texttowav -m $m - \
  $(echo $m | rev | cut -d/ -f1 | rev).wav; \
  done

To generate all sound files::

  for x in $(echo $NUMS); do \
  echo $x. | python3 texttowav -m tts_models/en/ljspeech/tacotron2-DCA - $x.wav; \
  done

Then truncate silence and convert to ogg.
